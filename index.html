Greetings! My name is Joshua and I am an M.D. candidate at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City. Welcome to my personal website.

In addition to my interests in all things medicine, I study and am fascinated by psychopharmacology and how substances modulate our behavior and experiences. I also love learning about history, philosophy, etymology, cultural practices, and topics in evolutionary biology, general and organic chemistry, and physics. Please explore the links below to learn more.
